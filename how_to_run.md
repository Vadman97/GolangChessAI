# Running
To run a 10-game 5-second think time competition between ABDADA parallel algorithm and MTDf serial algorithm, run `./main competition`

Running the full frontend is more difficult and will require building from source.

To run the frontend, clone our repository from https://github.com/Vadman97/GolangChessAI and run `npm install; npm start; go build -o main FOLDER_WHERE_YOU_CLONED_TO/cmd/main.go; ./main`
